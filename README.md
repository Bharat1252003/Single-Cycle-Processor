# Single Cycle Processor
 The project involved designing a single cycle processor that performs 4-bit arithmetic and logical instructions using 4 general purpose registers.  Built a 4-bit ALU, register file, instruction decoder, program counter and a state machine to control the flow.  Simulated in MATLAB Simulink.
